# Monitoring with Elasticsearch (Fluentd) - EFK - Stack -> microk8s 

## What is fluentd ? 

  * fluentd aggregates different data like (app logs, systems logs a.s.o) - see References 

## Enable it:

```
# With microk8s you can enable this stack. 
microk8s enable fluentd 

# fluentd will run as daemonSets to aggregate data



```

## Problems that need to be fixed with microk8s 

```
# as of 04/2022 there seems some misleading information in the docs
# that keeps it from working (when it comes to access it)
